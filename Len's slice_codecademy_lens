#To keep track of the kinds of pizzas you sell, create a list called toppings that holds the following:

toppings =['pepperoni', 'pineapple', 'cheese','sausage','olives', 'anchovies', 'muschrooms']
print(toppings)


#To keep track of how much each kind of pizza slice costs, create a list called prices that holds:

prices=[2,6,1,3,2,7,2]
print (prices)

#Find the length of the toppings list and store it in a variable called num_pizzas.

num_pizzas =len(toppings)
print(num_pizzas)

#Print the string "We sell X different kinds of pizza!", with num_pizzas where the X is.

print("We sell "+  str(num_pizzas) + " diferent kinds of pizza!")

#Use zip to combine the two lists into a list called pizzas that has the structure:

pizzas= list(zip(toppings,prices))
print(pizzas)


#Sort pizzas so that the pizzas with the lowest prices are at the start of the list.

sorted_pizza = sorted(pizzas)
print(sorted_pizza)


#A man in a business suit walks in and shouts “I will have your MOST EXPENSIVE pizza!”
Get the last item of the pizzas list and store it in a variable called priciest_pizza.

priciest_pizza = sorted_pizza[-1]
print(priciest_pizza)


#.Three mice walk into the store. They don’t have much money (they’re mice), but they do each want different pizzas.
Slice the pizzas list and store the 3 lowest cost pizzas in a list called three_cheapest.

three_cheapest = sorted_pizza[0:3]
print(three_cheapest)

#Your boss wants you to do some research on $2 slices. Count the number of occurrences of 2 in the prices list, and store the result in a variable called num_two_dollar_slices. Print it out.

num_two_dollar_slices =prices.count(2)
print(num_two_dollar_slices)
